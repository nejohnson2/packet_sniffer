# Packet Sniffer

The python file ```packet_sniffer.py``` uses the ```scapy``` python library to capture probe requests and write them to a ```CouchDB``` database.  This was successfully used on a raspberry pi.  The python file ```nsheyypy.py``` is an attempt to port the [Nsheyy](https://github.com/antiboredom/nsheyy_gui/releases) project into python which uses the ```tinSniffer``` application developed by [samatt](https://github.com/samatt).  This is unfinished.
